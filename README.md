# TravelBucket

TravelBucket is a travel bucket list app which allows users to add places, landmarks, or items they want to see to a list
which they can they check off once they have seen them. Items that have not yet been completed appear on the list without
a date or a photo. Once the user has completed an item, he or she can add a photo from their camera roll, add the date
it was completed, and add notes about the visit. New items can be added to the list using Google Places API and Autocomplete.
The user will eventually be able to see added and completed items on a map using Google Maps API.

Technologies used: Swift 3, Xcode, Google Maps API, Google Places API
